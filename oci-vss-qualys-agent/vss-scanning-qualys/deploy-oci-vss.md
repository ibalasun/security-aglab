# Deploy Vulnerability Scanning Service and Supporting Configuration

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be creating a required dynamic group, policy, vault, license secret, scanning recipe, and required target rules to enable the scanning of compute resources in **VSS VCN**.

Estimated time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

- Configure Dynamic Group and Policy
- Configure Vault and add Agent License Secret
- Configure Scanning Recipe and Target
- Validate Scanned Targets and Agent Installation

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)
- User must have required permissions, and quota to deploy resources.

## Task 1: Create Dynamic Group and Required Policy

1. From the OCI Services menu, click **Dynamic Groups** under **Identity & Security**. Select your region on the right part of the screen:

   ![Create Dynamic Group Home Page](../common/images/create-dynamic-group-home-page.png " ")

2. You will be creating **Dynamic Group** which will include **instances OCIDs** or **compartment OCIDs** which you want to scan. Based on the below tables you will create a Dynamic Group.

      | Resource | Name                               | Comment                                                    |
      |---------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Dynamic Group | vss-demo                        | Example: All {instance.compartment.id = enter compartment ocid_here}  |

    > **Note:** You can also specify the entire tenancy. 

3. Select **Create Dynamic Group** and fill out the dialog box for creating a dynamic group:

      - **Name**: Enter a Name
      - **Description**: Enter a friendly name
      - **Include Instance That Match**: Select **All of the following**
      - **Match Instances with**: Select Compartment OCID and Enter your compute resources Compartment OCID.

   ![Create Dynamic Group](../common/images/create-dynamic-group.png " ")

4. Verify all the information and Click **Add Rule** and **Create**

5. This will create a Dynamic Group with the following components.

   *New Dynamic Group with Required Compute Compartment OCIDs to scan*

6. From the OCI Services menu, click **Policies** under **Identity & Security**. Select your region on the right part of the screen:

7. Now you will be creating **Policy** which will grant permission for the dynamic group to access secrets and have data sent back from **Qualys**. Based on the below tables you will create a policy.

      - **Name**: Enter Policy Name
      - **Description**: Enter Policy Description
      - **Compartment**: Ensure the Root compartment is selected
         - You can define policy at your Root or Required Compartment level based on your need.
         - Please follow the official docs mentioned in the **Learn More** section to know more about **Agent-Based Qualys Policies**. 
      - **Policy Builder**: Enter policy
         - **Entries**: Ensure you enter the correct dynamic group name in our case itâ€™s **vss-demo**

   ```
   <copy>
   Define tenancy ocivssprod as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaa6zt5ejxod5pgthsq4apr5z2uzde7dmbpduc5ua3mic4zv3g5ttma
   Allow dynamic-group vss-demo to read vaults in tenancy
   Allow dynamic-group vss-demo to read keys in tenancy
   Allow dynamic-group vss-demo to read secret-family in tenancy
   Endorse dynamic-group vss-demo to read objects in tenancy ocivssprod
   </copy>
   ```

   ![Create Dynamic Group Policy](../common/images/create-dynamic-group-policy.png " ")

8. Verify all the information and Click **Create**.

9. This will create a policy with the following components.

   *New Policy Present in Root compartment associated with a dynamic group created earlier*

## Task 2: Create Vault and Secret
