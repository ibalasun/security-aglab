# Explore Scanning and Vulnerabilities Reports

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be validating scanning & vulnerability reports from **VSS**, **CloudGuard**, and **Qualys VMDR** platforms.

> **Please Read**: Qualys performs OCI hosts scan every **four hours** so you can view reports in the **Qualys** portal approximately in four hours. Similarly, view Qualys scan results in the OCI Console within **12 hours** of creating the new scan target

Estimated time: 10 minutes.

### Objectives

- Validate Scanning and Vulnerabilities Reports from OCI VSS
- Validate Scanning and Vulnerabilities Reports from OCI CloudGuard
- Validate Scanning and Vulnerabilities Reports from Qualys VMDR Platform

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)
- User must have required permissions, and quota to deploy/view resources.

## Task 1: Validate Scanning and Vulnerabilities Reports from OCI VSS

1. From the OCI Services menu, click **Scanning** under **Identity & Security**. Select your region on the right part of the screen.

2. Navigate to your **Scanning Reports** to view individual **host target** reports. 

   ![Compute Hosts Scanning Reports](../common/images/compute-target-scanning-reports.png " ")

3. Navigate to your **Vulnerabilities Reports** to view individual **CVE: QID** reports. 

   ![Compute Hosts Vulnerabilities Reports](../common/images/compute-target-vulnerabilities-reports.png " ")

4. Click on vulnerability to know more about and related details, for example, **QID: 159493**:

   ![Compute Hosts Vulnerability Details](../common/images/compute-target-vulnerabilities-details-reports.png " ")

## Task 2: Explore Scanning and Vulnerabilities Reports from OCI CloudGuard

1. From the OCI Services menu, click **CloudGuard** under **Identity & Security**. Select your region on the right part of the screen.

   ![Compute Hosts CloudGuard Home Page](../common/images/cloudguard-home-page.png " ")

2. Navigate to your **Problems** to view individual **host target** problems.

## Task 3: Validate Scanning and Vulnerabilities Reports from Qualys VMDR

1. Connect to **Qualys VMDR** and navigate to **Dashboard** to view **vulnerabilities** overview and **assets**:

   ![Qualys VMDR Dashboard](../common/images/qualys-vmdr-vulnerabilities.png " ")

2. Navigate to **Vulnerabilities > Assets** to view individual **assets** details: 

   ![Qualys VMDR Vulnerabilities](../common/images/qualys-vmdr-vulnerabilities-hosts.png " ")

3. Navigate to **Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability** tab to view additional reports: 

   ![Qualys VMDR Vulnerabilities](../common/images/qualys-vmdr-vulnerabilities-hosts-details.png " ")

4. Click on individual vulnerability to know more about the details and perform needed action:
