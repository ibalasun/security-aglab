### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
 * Create AG Group and AG Policies
 * Create AG Service Instance
 * Access the AG console url
 * Download the Agent to perform the integration with OIG

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A valid Oracle OCI tenancy, with OCI administrator privileges. 

## Task 1: Create AG Group 

1. In the OCI console, click the Navigation Menu icon in the top left corner to display the *Navigation menu.* Click *Identity and Security* in the *Navigation menu*. Select *Domains* from the list of products.

    ![Navigate to Domains](images/navigate-select-domain.png)

2. On the Domains page, Click on *ag-domain* which is the identity domain you have created. Select *Groups*. Click on *Create Group*

    ![Select the Identity Domain](images/select-identity-domain.png)

    ![Select Groups](images/select-groups.png)

    Enter the following details to create the *ag-group*
    ```
    Name: ag-group
    Description: Access governance group to manage users 
    Users: Select the Admin user from the list of users. 
    ```
    Click *Create*

    ![Create AG Group](images/create-ag-group.png)

    The *Group* has been created succesfully. 


## Task 2: Create AG Policies 


1. In the OCI console, click the Navigation Menu icon in the top left corner to display the *Navigation menu.* Click *Identity and Security* in the *Navigation menu*. Select *Policies* from the list of products.

    ![Navigate to Policies](images/navigate-policies.png)

3. On the Policies page, Click on *Create Policy* to create 3 policies : ag-access-policy, orm-access-policy, compute-policy


    ```
    Name: ag-access-policy
    Description: IAM policy for granting ag-group access to manage access governance instances
    Compartment: Ensure your root compartment is selected
    Policy Builder: Select the show manual editor checkbox
    Statement 1: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to manage all-resources in tenancy
    ```

    Click *Create*

    ```
    Name: orm-access-policy
    Description: IAM policy for granting ag-group access to manage resource manager stacks and jobs
    Compartment: Ensure your root compartment is selected
    Policy Builder: Select the show manual editor checkbox 
    Statement 1: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to manage orm-stacks in tenancy
    Statement 2: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to manage orm-jobs in tenancy
    ```

    Click *Create*


    ```
    Name: compute-policy
    Description: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to manage instance-family in tenancy
    Compartment: Ensure your root compartment is selected
    Policy Builder: Select the show manual editor checkbox 
    Statement 1: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to manage instance-family in tenancy
    Statement 2: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to use app-catalog-listing in tenancy
    Statement 3: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to manage volume-family in tenancy
    Statement 4: Allow group ag-domain/ag-group to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy
    ```

    Click *Create*


    ![Policies have been created](images/policies-created.png)

     The *Policies* have been created successfully.


## Task 3: Create AG Service instance 

1. In the OCI console, click the Navigation Menu icon in the top left corner to display the *Navigation menu.* Click *Identity and Security* in the *Navigation menu*. Select *Access Governance* from the list of products.
    ![Create Service Instance](images/oci-console.png)

3. On the Access Governance page, select *Service Instances.*Click on *Create Service Instance*


    ```
    Name: service-instance
    Description: Oracle Access Governance service instance
    Compartment: Ensure your root compartment is selected
    ```
    ![Create Service Instance](images/create-service-instance.png)
    ![Service Instance details](images/ag-service-instance.png)

4. Wait for the service instance to have the *Active* status . Note down this URL as we will be using it in the further labs. 

    ![Service Instance is Active](images/ag-url.png)

5. Click on the Service Instance to access the URL.
