# Perform access review task

## Introduction

**Access reviews** can be carried out from the **Oracle Access Governance** console by users with the following roles, which are based on data attributes derived from the connected system:

* **User** (review access assigned to me/self)
* **Manager** (review access assigned to users in my team)
* **Owner** (review access assigned to users over resources I own)

Based on the workflow setup in the first lab **Create Access Review Campaign**, **Oracle Access Governance** distributes access reviews to corresponding reviewers across the selected organization. In this lab, **employee user** is the first-level reviewer, and **user manager** is the second-level reviewer. By leveraging the **prescriptive analytics** and **insights** embedded in access reviews, employees and user managers can make informed decisions about access entitlements. Users can also bulk approve low-risk items based on **AI/ML recommendations** from the system. 
* Estimated Time: 20 minutes
* Persona: Employee and User Manager

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

You may do a search for the access review tasks created from the first lab based on the **Review source** aka **Campaign name** value in the middle column of the table, which you note down in **Lab 1**. In case the **campaign** from the first lab has not been started yet, you can also pick a **review task** from a pre-configured campaign. In that case, select the access review tasks with **Review source** as **...Org Access Review Example**, for example, **Support Org Access Review Example**. To review the access, please follow the below steps:
    - Check review task information such as **Identity name**, **Assignment name**, **Manager name**, **Assignment type**, and **Due days** for which the task is raised.
    - Filter the review tasks list by selecting **Recommend Accept** or **Recommend Review**. Based on **Prescriptive Analytics** powered by ML algorithm, **Oracle Access Governance** recommends action for each review item based on calculated risk scores and analytics. 
    - You may choose to accept the review item by clicking on **Accept** in the **Actions** column. This action is suggested for **Recommend Accept** items only. 
    - In case you want to view the analytic insights, especially for items flagged as **Recommend Review**, you may click on the **View** in **Insights** column to review a task.

On the contrary, **revoke** access by an **employee user** will not trigger next-level access review by the **manager user**.
