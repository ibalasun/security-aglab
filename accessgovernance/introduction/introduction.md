This lab walks you through the steps to get started using **Oracle Access Governance** with a popular use case - **access review certification campaign**. Acme corporation is using **Oracle Identity Governance (OIG)** to manage and govern the application access of its employees and contractors. As part of their cloud strategy, they want to optimize their access review certification campaign process with a cloud-native solution while leveraging pre-existing on-premises **Oracle Identity Governance (OIG)** investment. **Oracle Access Governance** SaaS solution is designed for this purpose and serves as a natural extension of **OIG** solution. With **Oracle Access Governance**, Acme can immediately benefit from automated access review workflows that layer in prescriptive analytics with intuitive dashboards/reports while preserving their existing **OIG** investment. 

**Oracle Access Governance** allows Acme's: 
- **Campaign administrator** to run intelligent access review campaigns for access governance and compliance
- **Access reviewers** to review identity insights and take informed decisions based on **prescriptive analytics**
- **Users** and **user managers** to validate access assigned to self and their direct reports, respectively.
