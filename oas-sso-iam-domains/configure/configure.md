# Deploy the stack to configure OAS, AppGate and Identity Domain

## Introduction

Using this stack we will be able to configure **OAS, App Gateway and Identity Domain**. As part of this stack, a Enterprise application will be created under **Identity Domain**.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 30 minutes


### Objectives

1.	Configure **OAS Application**
2. 	Configure **App Gateway**
3.	Create the **Enterprise Application** under **Identity Domain** 

### Prerequisites

1. Once the **Stack2- Configure.zip** is downloaded, unzip the zip file and replace the the content of the **.pem** files (AppGate\_PrivateKey.pem and OAS\_PrivateKey.pem) with your respective content of the private key.

## Task 1: Deploy the Configuration Stack via Resource Manager

1. Once logged in to OCI Console, navigate to **Developer Services** then select **Stacks** under **Resource Manager**. Now click on **Create Stack**.

**Note** The stack automatically picks up the working directory, provides the stack with a name and the working compartment gets selected. The Stack Name and Compartment can be changed if required.

3. Now, on the **Configure variables** section, fill in the below mentioned values, then click on **Next**

	1. *Public IP address of your AppGate Server*
	2. *Identity Domain URL - Domain URL of the Deployed Domain . **Note** Remove **:443** from the end of the Domain URL.*
   	3. *Client ID - Please enter the Client ID of your IDCS Confidential App*
    4. *Client Secret - Please enter the Client Secret of your IDCS Confidential App*
	5. *OAS Landing Page URL - This will cone from Stack one after the OAS Server will be deployed*
	6. *OAS Origin Server URL - This will cone from Stack one after the OAS Server will be deployed*
	7. *OAS Weblogic IP Address - This will cone from Stack one after the OAS Server will be deployed*
