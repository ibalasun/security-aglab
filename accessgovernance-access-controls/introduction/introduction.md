This lab walks you through the steps to get started using **Oracle Access Governance** with several use cases - **access controls, access reviews, and policy reviews**. In this workshop, a ficticious corporation is using Oracle Access Governance to manage and govern the application access of its employees and contractors. This lab shows how the database is connected to AG as a target system and implement access control by creating identity collections, approval workflows, roles, access bundles, and centralized policies. It also shows how to perform access review and policy review campaigns, and associated review tasks.
