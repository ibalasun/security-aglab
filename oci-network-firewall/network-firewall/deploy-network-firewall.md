# Deploy Network Firewall and Supporting Configuration

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be creating **Network Firewall Policy**, and **Network Firewall**, updating required routes and policies to support traffic between VCNs.

Estimated time: 45 minutes.

### Objectives

- Configure Network Firewall Policy
- Launch Network Firewall in Firewall VCN 
- Demonstrate updating routing tables 
- Validate route tables association

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)
- User must have required permissions, and quota to deploy resources.

## Task 1: Configure Network Firewall Policy

1. From the OCI Services menu, click **Network Firewall Policies** under **Identity & Security**. Select your region on the right part of the screen:

   ![Navigate to Network Firewall Window](../common/images/network-firewall-window.png " ")

2. Below table represents what you will be creating. Click on **Create Policy** icon to create new **Network Firewall Policy**:

      | Policy Name                           | Comment                                                    |
      |---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
      | network-firewall-policy-demo          |  You will be adding required policy configuration in **Lab3** so you will allow default **allow all** rule first. |

## Task 2: Create Network Firewall in Firewall VCN

1. From the OCI Services menu, click **Network Firewall** under **Identity & Security**. Select your region on the right part of the screen:

   ![Navigate to Network Firewall Window](../common/images/network-firewall-window.png " ")

2. Below table represents what you will be creating. Click on **Create Network Firewall** icon to create new **Network Firewall**:

      | Firewall Name                           | Comment                                                    |
      |---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
      | oci-network-firewall-demo|  You will be creating Network Firewall in **Firewall-Subnet** to protect public and OCI workloads. |

   ![Create Network Firewall Button](../common/images/create-network-firewall-button-click.png " ")

3. Fill out the dialog box:

      - **Firewall Name**: Provide a name
      - **Compartment**: Ensure your compartment is selected
      - **Network Firewall Policy**: Select **network-firewall-policy-demo** from dropdown. 
      - **Enforcement Point**: 
        - **Virtual Cloud Network**: Select **firewall-vcn** from dropdown.
        - **Subnet**: Select **firewall-subnet** from dropdown.
        - **[Optional] Availability Domain**: Select required **AD** from dropdown.

   ![Create Network Firewall](../common/images/create-network-firewall.png " ")

4. Verify all the information and Click **Create Network Firewall**.

5. This will create a Network Firewall with the following components.

    *Network Firewall within Firewall-Subnet*

   > **Please Read**: OCI Network Firewall deployment will take close to **30-35 mins** initially. Ensure that this task is complete before proceeding further.

6. Verify the **Network Firewall** IP address which you would need to update route tables in the next task. 

   ![Network Firewall Created Successfully](../common/images/created-network-firewall.png " ")

## Task 3: Update Route Tables on Firewall-VCN

1. Navigate to the **firewall-vcn** and select **VCN-INGRESS-RouteTable** route table. 

2. Click **Add Route Rules**

3. Select the Target Type as **Private IP** and enter the Secondary IP Address Associated with **Network Firewall** IP Address.

4. Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**

    - In this case, you will put all default CIDR **0.0.0.0/0** which is incoming traffic from Spoke VCNs via **DRG** to Active Firewall. You can also enter the CIDR block for the Firewall VCNs or Public/On-Prem Subnets if needed.  i.e.: 10.10.1.0/24 or 10.10.2.0/24

5. Add **Description**.

   ![Update VCN Ingress Route Table in Firewall VCN](../common/images/updated-vcn-ingress-route-table-entries-firewall-vcn.png " ")

6. Click **Add Route Rules** to finish.

7. Navigate to the **firewall-vcn** and select **ClientSubnetRouteTable** route table. 

8. Click **Add Route Rules**

9. Enter the required entries as below, and click on **Another Route Rule** as needed:

    - **First Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **10.10.2.0/24** for outgoing traffic of Server Subnet via **OCI Network Firewall**.
        - **Target Selection**: Enter **Network Firewall** IP Address. 
    - **Second Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **10.20.0.0/16** for outgoing traffic of Server Subnet via **OCI Network Firewall**.
        - **Target Selection**: Enter **Network Firewall** IP Address.  
    - **Third Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **0.0.0.0/0** for ensuring any outgoing traffic goes via **OCI Network Firewall**.
        - **Target Selection**: Enter **Network Firewall** IP Address.  

       > **Please Read**: Even though we are adding the **0.0.0.0/0** route rule it's needed to add **first entry** if you want to inspect intra-vcn subnets level inspection. Each route table has its local entry hence first entry is needed which will take precedence.

10. Add **Description** for each entry.

   ![Update Client Subnet Route Table in Firewall VCN](../common/images/update-client-subnet-route-table-entries-firewall-vcn.png " ")

11. Click **Add Route Rules** to finish.

12. Navigate to the **firewall-vcn** and select **ServerSubnetRouteTable** route table. 

13. Click **Add Route Rules**

14. Enter the required entries as below, and click on **Another Route Rule** as needed:

    - **First Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **10.10.1.0/24** for outgoing traffic of Client Subnet via **OCI Network Firewall**.
        - **Target Selection**: Enter **Network Firewall** IP Address. 
    - **Second Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **10.20.0.0/16** for outgoing traffic of Server Subnet via **OCI Network Firewall**.
        - **Target Selection**: Enter **Network Firewall** IP Address.   

15. Add **Description** for each entry.

   ![Update Server Subnet Route Table in Firewall VCN](../common/images/update-server-subnet-route-table-entries-firewall-vcn.png " ")

16. Click **Add Route Rules** to finish.

17. Navigate to the **firewall-vcn** and select **FirewallSubnetRouteTable** route table. 

18. Click **Add Route Rules**

    - **First Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **10.20.0.0/16** for outgoing traffic of Server Subnet via **OCI Network Firewall**.

## Task 4: Verify Route Tables associated with Subnets and Gateways

1. Below table includes the necessary subnets in each **VCN** and makes sure **Route Table** is attached to the right subnets and service gateway. 

    | VCN          | Resource Name/Type                       | Route Table Name                |
    |--------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
    | firewall-vcn | firewall-subnet                       | FirewallSubnetRouteTable           |
    | firewall-vcn | client-subnet                    | ClientSubnetRouteTable                  |
    | firewall-vcn | server-subnet                      | ServerSubnetRouteTable                |
    | firewall-vcn | Firewall VCN/DRG Firewall VCN Attachment | VCN-INGRESS-RouteTable                     |
    | firewall-vcn | hubServiceGateway/Service Gateway        | SGWRouteTable                   |
    | spoke-vcn    | serverA-subnet              | ServerASubnet Route Table for spoke-vcn |
    | spoke-vcn    | serverB-subnet              | ServerBSubnet Route Table for spoke-vcn |

2. Below example reflects how to attach the correct route table based on the above table to one of the resources **Service Gateway**:
