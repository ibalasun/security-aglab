# Network Firewall Traffics Validation and Security Features

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be creating required security rules, and routes associated with **Network Firewall** traffic flow to support different use-case and validate traffics within, between, and from VCNs.

Estimated time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives

- Validate North-South Inbound Traffic
- Validate North-South Outbound Traffic
- Validate East-West Intra VCN Traffic
- Validate East-West Inter VCN Traffic
- Validate IPS/IDS Traffic
- Validate URL Filtering Traffic
- Validate SSL Forward Proxy Traffic
- Validate North-South NAT Gateway Ingress Traffic

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)  
- User must have required permissions, and quota to deploy resources.

## Task 1: Validate North-South Inbound Traffic

1. From the OCI Services menu, click **Virtual Cloud Network** and navigate to **firewall-vcn**. 

   ![Navigation window for Virtual Cloud Networks](../common/images/vcn-home.png " ")

2. Click on **Create Route Table** on **Route Tables** resources under **firewall-vcn** section. You will be creating an Internet Gateway route table. Fill out the dialog box: 

      - **Name**: Provide a name; In your case **IGWRouteTable**
      - **Compartment**: Ensure your compartment is selected

3. Click **Another Route Rule**

4. Enter the required entries as below, and click on **Another Route Rule** as needed:

    - **First Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **10.10.1.0/24** for incoming traffic of Client Subnet via **OCI Network Firewall**.
        - **Target Selection**: Enter **Network Firewall** IP Address.

5. Verify all the information and Click **Create**.

   ![Validate NAT GW Traffic: Confirm Firewall Subnet Route Table Entry in Firewall VCN](../common/images/nat-gw-traffic-confirm-firewall-subnet-rt-firewall-vcn.png " ")

   > **Please Read**: We have updated the route table here with default route entry via **NAT-GW** and access to **Client-VM** using your public IP via **IGW**. 

4. Click on **Create Route Table** on **Route Tables** resources under **firewall-vcn** section. You will be creating a NAT Gateway route table. Fill out the dialog box: 

      - **NAME**: Provide a name; In your case **NAT-GW-RT**
      - **COMPARTMENT**: Ensure your compartment is selected

5. Click **Another Route Rule**

6. Enter the required entries as below, and click on **Another Route Rule** as needed:

    - **First Entry**
        - Select the Target Type as **Private IP** 
        - Enter the **Destination CIDR Block**
            - In this case you will put **10.10.1.0/24** for incoming traffic of Client Subnet via **OCI Network Firewall**.
        - **Target Selection**: Enter **Network Firewall** IP Address.

7. Verify all the information and Click **Create**.

   ![Create NAT GW Route Table in Firewall VCN](../common/images/ngw-route-table-firewall-vcn.png " ")

8. This will create NAT Gateway Route Table for firewall-vcn with the following components.

    | Client VM | Internet Traffic   | HTTP and HTTPS| Allowed with selected URLs         | rule-client-to-outbound-allow-all-traffic                     |

12. You can also **Block** the traffic at the **NAT Gateway** level which will also allow you to validate stop traffic. 

   ![Block NAT GW Traffic in Firewall VCN](../common/images/block-nat-gw-traffic-firewall-vcn.png " ")

13. Below diagram validates that the Client VM connects to the Internet over HTTPS/SSL traffic. 

   ![Terminal Output of NAT GW Traffic from Client VM to Internet](../common/images/terminal-output-nat-gw-client-internet-traffic.png " ")

14. You can also verify traffic from **Traffic Logs** on your **Network Firewall** resource. Data *filters* are available, below screenshot shows **policy-rule** filtered traffic:

   ![Logs Output of NAT GW Traffic from Client To Internet Allow Traffic via Network Firewall](../common/images/network-firewall-logs-nat-gw-client-vms-internet-allow-traffic.png " ")

   ![Detailed Logs Output of NAT GW Traffic from Client To Internet Allow Traffic via Network Firewall](../common/images/network-firewall-detailed-logs-nat-gw-client-vms-internet-allow-traffic.png " ")

## Task 9: Explore SGW Gateway Ingress Routing Traffic

1. You can also use **Service Gateway** ingress routing capabilities to ensure traffic destined to **OCI Network** inspected by **Network Firewall**. 

   > **Please Read** Currently you can't create NAT-GW/IGW route entries in the same route table as **SGW**. So you would have to modify your use-case to 

2. You could consider deploying another **Network Firewall** in a private subnet so **OCI SGW Network** traffic can be inspected by this new firewall. 

3. You should consider firewall pricing too which plays a critical role when designing architecture.

***Congratulations! You have completed the lab.***

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
