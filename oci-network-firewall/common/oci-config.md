# Configure Required Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Components

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be creating required virtual cloud networks (VCNs), subnets in each VCN, dynamic routing gateways (DRG), route tables, and spoke VCN compute instances to support traffic between VCNs.

Estimated time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

- Demonstrate launching Spoke VCN and supporting configuration 
- Demonstrate launching Dynamic Routing Gateways and supporting configuration 
- Demonstrate launching Route Tables on each VCN and supporting configuration
- Launch Compute Instances in Firewall and Spoke VCNs.

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)
- User must have required permissions, and quota to deploy resources.

## Task 5: Launch Compute instances in Firewall VCN

1. Launch **Cloud Shell** by clicking the icon next to the region name on the top right of the OCI console. ('<=' icon)

2. Once cloud Shell is launched. Enter command **ssh-keygen**, and press enter for all prompts. This will create an ssh key pair. Enter command.

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      cd .ssh
      cat id_rsa.pub
      </copy>
      ```
   
   Copy the key displayed. This will be used when creating the compute instance.

3. From the OCI services menu, Click **Instances** under **Compute**.
 
4. On the left sidebar, select the **Compartment** in which you placed your VCN under **List Scope**. Click **Create Instance**. You will be creating **2** instances as per below table:

      - The VCN created is populated: **Spoke VCN**
      - The subnet created is populated: 
        - Select **ServerA-subnet** for ServerA VM. 
        - Select **ServerB-subnet** for ServerB VM.  

8. Ensure **PASTE PUBLIC KEYS** is selected under **Add SSH Keys**. Paste the public key copied earlier.
 
   > **Note:** If the 'Service limit' error is displayed choose a different shape from VM.Standard.E4.Flex, VM.Standard2.1, VM.Standard.E2.1, VM.Standard1.1, VM.Standard.B1.1 OR choose a different AD.

   > **Note:** If you already have your ssh-key available you can skip copying from cloud-shell and paste your public key and use the private key associated with that for accessing the instance.

9. Click **Create** and wait for Instance to be in **Running** state. 

10. Repeat step 5 to 9 based on the **table** provided in **step 4** for another instance.
